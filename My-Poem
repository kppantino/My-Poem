Life is full of ups and downs.
So don't keep that face only know a frown.
Get out and explore outside your room.
'Cause things will be better in time and soon.

See the stars shine bright at night.
Turn of the light and watch the night light. 
Just like those when time is right. 
You'll be the star with all your might.
